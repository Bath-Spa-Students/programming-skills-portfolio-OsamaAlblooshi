#Write an if-else statement that assigns O to the variable b if the variable a is less than 10. Otherwise, it should assign 99 to the variable b.
# Assuming you have a variable named 'a'
a = 8  # You can change the value of a as needed

# Using an if-else statement to check if a is less than 10
if a < 10:
    b = 0
else:
    b = 99

# Print the value of b
print("b =", b)
